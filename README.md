# sqlops-widgets

This project has been split into the following projects now that SQL Ops Studio has support for an extension market place and it made sense to track these as separate projects.

[sqlops-mssql-instance-insights](https://github.com/Matticusau/sqlops-mssql-instance-insights)

SQL Operations Studio (sqlopsstudio) is the new cross-platform, cross-database open source tool released by Microsoft. The tool provides the ability to customise the dashboard with different widgets that are either built-in or custom. This project focuses on building some custom widgets to extend the functionality to include important information for DBA's and Developers.
